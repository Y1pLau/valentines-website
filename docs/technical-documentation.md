## Gift Exchange Component Documentation

### Overview
The Gift Exchange component is a React-based feature that displays a bidirectional gift exchange history between partners. It uses Material-UI (MUI) for styling and component structure.

### Component Structure
- **Component Name**: `GiftExchange`
- **Location**: `src/components/GiftExchange.js`

### Data Structure
```javascript
giftsData = {
  toGirlfriend: Array<Gift>,
  fromGirlfriend: Array<Gift>
}

type Gift = {
  name: string,
  description: string,
  date: string,
  image: string
}
```

### Key Features
1. Displays gifts in two sections:
   - Gifts given to girlfriend
   - Gifts received from girlfriend
2. Each gift is displayed as a card containing:
   - Gift image
   - Gift name
   - Description
   - Date of exchange

### UI Components Used
- Box: Main container wrapper
- Typography: Text elements for headings and content
- Grid: Responsive layout system
- Card: Gift display container
- CardContent: Gift information container
- CardMedia: Gift image display

### Styling
- Uses MUI's `sx` prop for styling
- Semi-transparent white background for cards
- White text for better contrast on dark backgrounds
- Responsive grid layout (12 columns)
- Consistent padding and spacing

### Responsive Behavior
The grid system adapts to different screen sizes:
- xs (mobile): 1 card per row (12 columns)
- sm (tablet): 2 cards per row (6 columns)
- md (desktop): 3 cards per row (4 columns)

### Implementation Details
1. Static Data Management
   - Gift data is currently stored in a static object
   - Each gift entry includes name, description, date, and image URL

2. Component Organization
   - Single responsibility component
   - Clear separation between data and presentation
   - Consistent styling through MUI system

3. Performance Considerations
   - Efficient rendering through Grid system
   - Optimized image loading through CardMedia
   - Minimal state management requirements
